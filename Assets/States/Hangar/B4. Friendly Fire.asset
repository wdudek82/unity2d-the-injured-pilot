  storyText: 'You tear off a piece of metal framing from your leather airship pilot
    arour and hold it ready as a shiv of sorts. As the door opens you rush at your
    captor, leaping like a crazy person and hollering a primal creem of rage.


    Payback time for your beating and from all the pain these dirty Festers have caused
    your family. You drive home your mental shiv. You hear the crunch of bones and
    feel slice of flesh.'
